## Hi there 👋
I'm Mitchi! I'm 24 and from the UK!
I've dipped my toe into the world of programming a few times over my life but never really got too far. I could read some code but definitely not write it. But thanks to AI (Yeah, yeah. I know we're all sick of it by now) I'm finally able to make something.

## SpeakThat!
My flagship project right now is SpeakThat! A notification reader for Android devices. It's the most advanced app of its kind, and the only open-source option!
Honestly I only started making it because I needed it for myself but was surprised when lots of other people downloaded it and started using it as well. Thank you to everyone who has supported the project this early, it means a lot to me. I'm working as fast as I can to make sure it runs smoothly for everyone!
